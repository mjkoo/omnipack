## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit policy separates app families from package identities

The system SHALL load a versioned committed composition policy. A candidate
SHALL retain original source, source origin, package id and normalized project
URL. These fields SHALL identify a candidate after identical duplicates collapse;
different records sharing that identity SHALL fail rather than be chosen by order.
Policy candidate selectors SHALL match this original identity exactly once.
Corrections SHALL NOT recursively match other rules. Unmatched or ambiguous selectors,
duplicate selectors, invalid targets, unknown fields and inconsistent rules SHALL
fail with the affected selector identified.

A candidate SHALL default to family `package:<effective-package-id>`. Explicit
family assignments SHALL use the separate `app:` namespace and SHALL NOT be
inferred from names, categories or repository ancestry. A candidate rule SHALL
contain a `match` selector and a `rationale`, SHALL permit an effective
package-id correction (`packageId`) and a family assignment (`family`) for
candidates that are not track-only, and SHALL preserve original provenance.
If the ingested candidate has `trackOnly: true` in its normalized settings,
a matching rule containing either `family` or `packageId` SHALL fail the build
with the affected selector identified, including a `packageId` equal to the
original id. This restriction SHALL apply before exclusions and selection,
regardless of whether the candidate would win or be denied. A track-only
candidate without either assignment SHALL retain its ingested id and default
`package:<id>` family; a selector-and-rationale-only rule SHALL remain valid.
Any candidate that is not track-only whose effective package id, whether its
ingested id or its rule's corrected id, equals the ingested id of a
track-only candidate SHALL also fail the build with that candidate's selector
identified. This restriction SHALL apply whether or not the candidate has a
rule, and SHALL likewise apply before exclusions and selection, regardless of
whether either candidate would win or be denied.

A rule SHALL NOT set eligibility or dual
preference, which come only from the build's source: an `eligible` or
`dualPreferred` field SHALL fail as an unknown candidate-rule field with the
rule and field identified. Identity corrections SHALL have recorded primary APK
manifest evidence. Rules projecting to the same effective id and normalized URL
SHALL agree on family, so rendered-family interpretation is unambiguous, and a
projection SHALL carry the family only. Build SHALL reject any candidate
sharing that rendered key whose family contradicts the projection, including
candidates without their own rule. Projections SHALL impose no offline
eligibility restriction, because source-derived eligibility cannot be
reconstructed from rendered entries. Composition metadata SHALL NOT be
serialized into Obtainium app records.

#### Scenario: Different package ids represent replacement builds

- **WHEN** explicit policy assigns a standard build and a different-package dual
  build to one family
- **THEN** they compete within that family for dual selection
- **AND** each selected output retains its build's own effective package id

#### Scenario: Similar fork names have no family declaration

- **WHEN** two candidates have different ids and similar names or repository ancestry
- **THEN** they remain separate default families

#### Scenario: Corrected package participates in collisions

- **WHEN** an evidenced rule changes a candidate's effective package id
- **THEN** grouping, exclusions and final package uniqueness use the effective id
- **AND** reports retain both original and effective ids

#### Scenario: Rules disagree on a rendered identity

- **WHEN** two source-specific rules project to one effective id and URL but assign
  different families
- **THEN** configuration fails instead of making offline interpretation ambiguous

#### Scenario: A rule declares eligibility or dual preference

- **WHEN** a candidate rule carries an `eligible` or `dualPreferred` field
- **THEN** configuration fails with the rule and the unknown field identified

#### Scenario: Track-only resource is assigned to an app family

- **WHEN** a rule assigns a family to an ingested track-only candidate
- **THEN** the build fails with that selector identified before a pin or source ranking can hide or select the candidate

#### Scenario: Track-only identity is corrected or restated

- **WHEN** a rule supplies `packageId` for an ingested track-only candidate, whether different from or equal to its original id
- **THEN** the build fails with that selector identified

#### Scenario: Track-only candidate would be excluded

- **WHEN** a track-only candidate has a prohibited rule assignment and a package denial would remove it
- **THEN** the build fails on the invalid rule rather than ignoring it because of the denial

#### Scenario: Track-only candidate has a descriptive rule

- **WHEN** a track-only candidate has a matching rule containing only its selector and rationale
- **THEN** its ingested identity and default family remain unchanged and the rule does not cause rejection

#### Scenario: Identity correction takes a track-only id

- **WHEN** a rule for a candidate that is not track-only sets `packageId` equal to the ingested id of a track-only candidate
- **THEN** the build fails with that candidate's selector identified before exclusions, a pin or source ranking can hide either candidate

#### Scenario: Ingested id already equals a track-only id

- **WHEN** a candidate that is not track-only has an ingested id equal to the ingested id of a track-only candidate, and it has no rule or a rule containing only its selector and rationale
- **THEN** the build fails with that candidate's selector identified before exclusions, a pin or source ranking can hide either candidate
